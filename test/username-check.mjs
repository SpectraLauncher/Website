// /^[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+$/ at 3–30 characters. A generated username that fails that
// is worse than none at all — the account silently gets one it cannot use, and
// its owner is refused every time they try to save their own profile.
//
// Imported straight from the TypeScript source: Node strips the types, and
// `username-slug.ts` deliberately has no imports of its own so this needs no
// bundler to stand up.
